Contains three modules: Administrator (adds, deletes, or modifies words), Search, and a Guessing Game.

1. Administrator mode: 
Upon choosing this option, the user must sign in using an email and password (stored in an .xml file), and can then proceed to use its functionalities: add/modify/delete a word. Words can have a picture when added or not- if not, then a default picture will be added. Words are stored in a .xml file, photos are stored in the Resources folder.

2. Search mode:
Here a user can search words and see their category, definition, and associated photo. The search can be filtered by category. The user will see suggestions in a list below as they start typing a word.

3. Guessing game:
A game with five rounds where the player will guess the word based on its definition or image (only one of these will be displayed at once, and each time it will be chosen randomly). The five words to guess are randomly chosen from the .xml file. The player can restart the game.
